Dreamland Boutique - Web Pages
This repository contains two simple HTML pages designed for a vibrant and enchanting online shopping experience, specifically tailored for girls' products.

Files Included
girls-shopping-landing-page.html: The main landing page showcasing products.

purchase-thank-you-page.html: A confirmation page displayed after a successful purchase.

How to Use
To view these pages:

Save the code for each page into separate .html files (e.g., girls-shopping-landing-page.html and purchase-thank-you-page.html).

Open either file directly in your web browser.

On the girls-shopping-landing-page.html, click the "Buy Now" buttons to see how they link to product-detail-page.html (note: product-detail-page.html is a placeholder and would need to be created separately for full functionality). The "Back to Dreamland" button on the thank you page links back to the landing page.
